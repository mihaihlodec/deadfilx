- How to lose $10k a year by watching Netflix
- Netflix should be called Deadflix
- Netflix kills 20% of your life
- The real cost of watching Netflix

Disclaimer: choose for yourself. Approximations used and a lot of Claude's friend input was used.

Before there was Netflix and TV, what the actual fuck were people doing with their time? I asked by good friend Claude about this. He has a lot of good answers, not sure if they are true, but they are good enough. They were communicating with each other, fixing things around the house, inventing new stuff, mating and raising kids. Now, they only watch Netflix (or the similar). No more human relations, no more helping your neighbor, or inventing something on the side. Watch Netflix, scroll the phone and die.

Ofc, I am talking only about myself. Nobody is the slave of Netflix as much as I am. Got frustrated with my own laziness, so I decided to calculate how much time I wasted on Netflix. I only extracted data for Netflix (leaving Youtube and Twitter out) to not drive myself crazy when I'd see the total count.

I've been having this netflix account since 2023. So only 2 years. Before that, I was using some friends account which I no longer have access to. So, for the sake of this experiment, let's assume I'd never known about netflix before 2023. Ofc, it's not true, but leave it for now.

Assumptions:

- When watching something, I didn't do anything else - productive wise. Like debugging code or deepening my relationship with my wife.
- I watched all entries in my watch history, from beginning to end - not skipping parts or episodes.

The numbers I got using my script are, for the last 2 years, 2023-2024:

TOTAL Time LOST: 10 days, 21 hours, and 54 minutes
TOTAL Money$ LOST by watching: 11745.00$ considering you earn 45$ per hour
AVG Money$ LOST per year: 11745/2 = 5872.5$

Cost of subscription: 5$*12months = 60$

SO TOTAL $ LOST per year: 5872 + 60 = 5932$

Not considering: electricity, electronic device depreciation, etc.

Total Minutes: 15714
Total Hours: 261
Total Days: 10

Not considering compound interest or increasing my hourly rate:
In a 10 years period, I'd lose 5932 \* 10 = 59320$

Considering compound interest:
$93,628

So, in the last 2 years, I lost more than 10K.
Ok, money is not the only value in life. But the life is made up of time.

almost 11 full days of my life were lost. 11 days with no sleep, no going to the bathroom, no nothing. Just watching Netflix.
To have a clearer picture on the impact, let's think what 11 days (261 hours to be more precise) could translate to:

- ~32.5 work days, considering you work 8 hours per day
- ~32.5 sleep sessions, considering you sleep 8 hours per session
- ~260 training sessions. Or let's count the driving to/from the gym. It would get us only ~130 training sessions.
- Get to level A2 on Spanish/French on Duolingo (it takes like only 200-300 hours for that, as per my friend Claude)
- Meet with friends 65 times, considering going out takes you around 4 hours.
- Train for a marathon. Considering you train 8-10 hours per week for 16-20 weeks.
- Go on a 11 days vacation.
- Or don't do anything for 261 hours. meditate, sleep, dream or just be with your family.

Ok ok, got it. Money and time are not the only value in life.
But is health valuable?

You can say, Netflix does you good cause it's relaxing. In some way, it is. But not in the long term.
It's hard to quantify the health impact, but we can roughly estimate it:

- You watch 261 hours of a screen. In addition to the screen you work on, the screen you scroll on or the screen you read from. That's a lot of screen time. No good for your eyes - let's approximate to 10% more strain on your eyes per year.
- You stayed 261 hours on a couch. Let's be honest, nobody is Goggins to train or stretch while watching TV. You stayed on the couch like a smashed potato and you spine and limbs took a hit. Let's say 10% more strain on your back per year.
- You ate a lot more snacks. For me, I'd estimate to 1 bag of chips per 10 hours watched. So 26 bags of chips, which are anything but healthy.
- You ordered more food than usual. Instead of cooking your meal, you order a pizza or a burger. It goes much better with 2 hours of binge wathcing. I won't get again into the financial impact of this, but just remember that's also another hit on your wallet.

So what is the solution?
I get to watch TV/Netflix at the end of the day. When I'm too tired or my brain is too fried to do anything else. I think about it as relaxing my brain, getting dumber but also getting better. It's not. It's a lie. yes, maybe for a short time you feel good, not having to think about all the other things you could be doing. But it's not truely relaxing. It's a fake relaxation.

The solution? Create a relaxation plan.

My plan to get this time back

To mention:
when energy high - 80%> work on side projects
when energy medium - 50%> do house chores
when energy mid low - 30%> read or walk
when energy 0 - sleep, breathe, don't do anything. but FOR sure!!! don't watch any screen
when
when energy low
when food craving
when is summer/winter

- my wife also watched Netflix - so family household hit doubles
