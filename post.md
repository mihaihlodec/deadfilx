Disclaimer: choose for yourself. Approximations used and a lot of Claude's friend input was used. Nothing personal with Netflix (same applies to all the other streaming platforms, dumb scrolling apps or ways to waste time using a screen).

Problem statement:

Before there was Netflix and TV, what the actual fuck were people doing with their time? I asked by good friend Claude about this. He has a lot of good answers, not sure if they are true, but they are good enough. They were communicating with each other, fixing things around the house, inventing new stuff, mating and raising kids. Now, they only watch Netflix (or the similar). No more human relations, no more helping your neighbor, or inventing something on the side. Watch Netflix, scroll the phone and die.

Ofc, I am talking only about myself. Nobody is the slave of Netflix as much as I am. Got frustrated with my own laziness, so I decided to calculate how much time I wasted on Netflix. I only extracted data for Netflix (leaving Youtube and Twitter out) to not drive myself crazy when I'd see the total count.

I've been having this netflix account since 2023. So only 2 years. Before that, I was using some friends account which I no longer have access to. So, for the sake of this experiment, let's assume I'd never known about netflix before 2023. Ofc, it's not true, but leave it for now.

Assumptions:

- When watching something, I didn't do anything else - productive wise. Like debugging code or deepening my relationship with my wife.
- I watched all entries in my watch history, from beginning to end - not skipping parts or episodes.

The numbers I got using my script are, for the last 2 years, 2023-2024:

TOTAL Time LOST: 10 days, 21 hours, and 54 minutes
TOTAL Money$ LOST by watching: 11745.00$ considering I earn 45$ per hour
AVG Money$ LOST per year: 11745/2 = 5872.5$

Cost of subscription: 5$*12months = 60$

SO TOTAL $ LOST per year: 5872 + 60 = 5932$

Not considering: electricity, electronic device depreciation, etc.

Total Minutes: 15714
Total Hours: 261
Total Days: 10

Not considering compound interest or increasing my hourly rate:
In a 10 years period, I'd lose 5932 \* 10 = 59320$

Considering compound interest, at 7% per year:
$93,628

Ok, money is not the only value in life. Life is made up of time.

almost 11 full days of my life were lost. 11 days with no sleep, no going to the bathroom, no nothing. Just watching Netflix.
To have a clearer picture on the impact, let's think what 11 days (261 hours to be more precise) could translate to:

- ~32.5 work days, considering you work 8 hours per day
- ~32.5 sleep sessions, considering you sleep 8 hours per session
- ~260 training sessions. Or let's count the driving to/from the gym. It would get us only ~130 training sessions.
- Get to level A2 on Spanish/French on Duolingo (it takes like only 200-300 hours for that, as per my friend Claude)
- Meet with friends 65 times, considering going out takes you around 4 hours.
- Train for a marathon. Considering you train 8-10 hours per week for 16-20 weeks.
- Go on a 11 days vacation.
- Or don't do anything for 261 hours. meditate, sleep, dream or just be with your family.

Ok ok, got it. Money and time are not the only value in life.
But is health valuable?

You can say, Netflix does you good cause it's relaxing. In some way, it is. But not in the long term.
It's hard to quantify the health impact, but we can roughly estimate it:

- You watch 261 hours of a screen. In addition to the screen you work on, the screen you scroll on or the screen you read from. That's a lot of screen time. No good for your eyes or brain - let's approximate to 10% more strain on your eyes per year.
- You stayed 261 hours on a couch. Let's be honest, nobody is Goggins to train or stretch while watching TV. You stayed on the couch like a smashed potato and you spine and limbs took a hit. Let's say 10% more strain on your back per year.
- You ate a lot more snacks. For me, I'd estimate to 1 bag of chips per 10 hours watched. So 26 bags of chips, which are anything but healthy.
- You ordered more food than usual. Instead of cooking your meal, you order a pizza or a burger. It goes much better with 2 hours of binge wathcing. I won't get again into the financial impact of this, but just remember that's also another hit on your wallet.

Is there a solution?
I get to watch TV/Netflix at the end of the day. When I'm too tired or my brain is too fried to do anything else. I think about it as relaxing my brain, getting dumber but also getting better. It's not. It's a lie. yes, maybe for a short time you feel good, not having to think about all the other things you could be doing. But it's not truely relaxing. It's a fake relaxation.

The solution? Create a no-more-netflix-in-the-evening plan.

My plan to get this time back is based on the energy levels I could have at the end of the day.

To mention:
when energy high - 80%> work on side projects
when energy medium - 50%> do house chores
when energy mid low - 30%> read or walk
when energy 0 - sleep, breathe, don't do anything. but FOR sure!!! don't watch any screen
when
when energy low
when food craving
when is summer/winter

Want to make the drama even worse? Think about if you watched Netflix with you partner/friends/kids. Multiply the time/money/health lost by the number of people.
For me, my wife also watched Netflix - for the sake of it, let's assume she always watched exactly what I watched. SO the same amount of time was lost.

# How I Lost 260 hours and $10,000 by watching Netflix

I wasted 261 hours watching Netflix in the last 2 years.
That's 11 days of my life gone. No sleeping, no bathroom breaks, nothing - just pure Netflix for 11 days.

## The money cost

I created a script for myself to extract my Netflix watch history. The data hit me in the face. For 2023-2024:

- 15,714 minutes of watching, which translates to 261 hours or 11 full days.
  At an hourly rate of $45, that's $11,745 in potential earnings gone. Add the $60 yearly subscription, and I'm looking at $5,932 lost per year.

The long-term math is even scarier. Over 10 years with a 7% compound interest, this would cost me $93,628 in total. That's a down payment on a house or a new car, gone because I need to know what happened in Stranger Things.

## The time cost

Ok, let's assume money means nothing. But I guess time should mean something?! It's not like I only lost 261 hours. It's more of what I could have done with that time. Some examples:

- 32.5 work days, considering you work 8 hours per day
- 32.5 sleep sessions, considering you sleep 8 hours per session
- 260 gym sessions. Or let's be precise and also count the driving to/from the gym. It would get us only ~130 training sessions.
- Get to level A2 on Spanish/French on Duolingo (it takes like only 200-300 hours for that, as per my friend Claude)
- Meet with friends 65 times, considering going out takes around 4 hours.
- Train for a marathon. Considering you train 8-10 hours per week for 16-20 weeks.
- Go on a 11 days vacation.
- Or fucking don't do anything for 261 hours!!! Meditate, watch the ceiling or just think.

## The health tax

If the money and time wasn't impact wasn't enough. It's hard to quantify the health impact, but let's try to estimate it:

- You watch 261 hours of a screen. In addition to the screen you work on, the screen you scroll on or the screen you read from. That's a lot of screen time. No good for your eyes or brain - let's approximate to 10% more strain on your eyes per year.
- You stayed 261 hours on a couch. Let's be honest, nobody is Goggins to train or stretch while watching TV. You stayed on the couch like a smashed potato and your spine and limbs took a hit. Let's say 10% more strain on your back per year.
- You ate a lot more snacks. For me, I'd estimate to 1 bag of chips per 10 hours watched. So 26 bags of chips, which are anything but healthy.
- You ordered more food than usual. Instead of cooking your meal, you order a pizza or a burger. It goes much better with 2 hours of binge wathcing. I won't get again into the financial impact of this, but just remember that's also another hit on your wallet.

## The drama

Multiple all these numbers by how many people in your family that watch Netflix. For me, is "just" my wife. So for my small family, the updated numbers for last 2 years are:
31428 minutes (523 hours or 21 days)
$23490 (money)

## My personal solution

I used to justify Netflix as my way to relax after work. "My brain is fried", "I can't do anythin else". Aha, ok ok - so it's an energy issue, you little b\*\*\*\*.
Let's then match your alternatives to your energy levels:

- when ~~you are high~~ your energy is high -> work on side projects, do some cardio, go out with friends
- when your energy is medium -> do house chores, read a book, walk outside
- when your energy is low -> sleep
  Of course, define new alternatives for yourself, but JUST DON"T fallback to watching Netflix.
  Of course no.2, you cancel your subscription right away.

## The Relationship Cost

Here's the kicker: my wife watches everything with me. Double all these numbers to see the real household impact: nearly $12,000 and 522 hours lost per year. That's time we could have spent actually talking to each other, pursuing shared hobbies, or building something meaningful together.

## Disclaimer numero duo

This isn't about demonizing Netflix â€” it's just about being honest with myself at this time. Every episode I watch is a choice to not do something else. Sometimes that's fine. But when it becomes my default way to spend time after work or when tired, I'm just choosing to be passive about my life.
